### Cool ideas that could become a big idea, or be a cool pet project?

They're findable in the "ideas.txt" file.<br />
Each idea is listed with a number(or idea ID if you wanna sound *ϝαɳƈყ*), title and a description.<br />
If an idea doesn't fit onto one line, it is moved onto the next line and indented(tabbed).

E.g. below:
1. IdeaIdeaIdeaIdeaIdeaIdeaIdea  <-- too long, indented to next line<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IdeaContinued...IdeaContinued...IdeaContinued...  <-- INDENTED! like so.
