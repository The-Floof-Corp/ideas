1. A private, customisable version of youtube, 
    but it is ONLY your images/videos. Similar to a version of DropBox, or google photos, 
    and it would make it easy to share photos and videos across the world with family and friends.

2. An app that conbines all important things you need, in a quick layout. 
    For example: twitter/facebook posts from friends, emails, calendar events 
    whatsapp/signal/telegram messages and more.
    
3. A custom-made, open-source camera software designed to be used on a raspberry pi.
    See: https://github.com/The-Floof-Corp/ideas/blob/main/raspi-camera-v5 for the main plan.

4. A social media website designed to allow users to show/talk about their pet.
    It supports text(announcements), images and videos. There would also be a forum where any user can ask 
    anything about any kind of animal (Within reason). It's UI would be very minimal, all you can do is look at posts, 
    follow a topic/pet, leave comments and upvote comments based on whether they were helpful/funny or not. 
    The forum would function and be moderated like any other general q/a forum.
