1. A private, customisable version of youtube, 
    but it is ONLY your images/videos. Similar to a version of DropBox, or google photos, 
    and it would make it easy to share photos and videos across the world with family and friends.

2. An app that conbines all important things you need, in a quick layout. 
    For example: twitter/facebook posts from friends, emails, calendar events whatsapp/signal/telegram messages and more.
    
3. A custom-made, open-source camera software designed to be used on a raspberry pi.
    See: https://github.com/The-Floof-Corp/ideas/blob/main/raspi-camera-v5 for the main plan.
